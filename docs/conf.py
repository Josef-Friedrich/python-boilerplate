Note that attributes from imported modules will not be documented, because attribute documentation is discovered by parsing the source file of the current module.

    # autoclass_content
    # This value selects what content will be inserted into the main body of an autoclass directive. The possible values are:
    # "class" Only the class’ docstring is inserted. This is the default. You can still document __init__ as a separate method using automethod or the members option to autoclass.
    # "both"  Both the class’ and the __init__ method’s docstring are concatenated and inserted.
    # "init"  Only the __init__ method’s docstring is inserted.
    "class-doc-from": "both",
